## **Hi there!** <img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d04509037f646eab5c2d6d130574ef059fa8eef92e45a139a827a8d06e9d5042/68747470733a2f2f656d6f6a69732e736c61636b6d6f6a69732e636f6d2f656d6f6a69732f696d616765732f313533363335313037352f343539342f626c6f622d776176652e676966" alt="wave" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align: middle;"/>

I'm Iriel, a data enthusiast with a background in Computer Science and a recent graduate from the [**Hacktiv8**](https://www.hacktiv8.com/) Data Science Bootcamp.

I hold a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and recently completed the Hacktiv8 Data Science Bootcamp, gaining practical experience in data cleaning, analysis, modeling, and deployment.

Skilled in Python, SQL, and PostgreSQL, I enjoy turning data into insights that solve problems and drive impact.

I'm currently looking for opportunities to contribute to meaningful data-driven projects and grow within a dynamic and collaborative environment.

Beyond studying and projects, I also enjoy going out and taking casual trips 🚗, experimenting in the kitchen 🍳 and expressing myself through art 🎨, whether it’s making crafts ✂️ or spontaneous sketches ✏️.

Let’s connect!
