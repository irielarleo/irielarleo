Hi there! 👋  
I'm Iriel — a data enthusiast with a background in Computer Science and a recent graduate from the Hacktiv8 Data Science Bootcamp.

I hold a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and have built a strong foundation in data processing, statistical analysis, and machine learning. During the intensive bootcamp at Hacktiv8, I gained hands-on experience through real-world projects — from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), to building predictive models and deploying them.

I’m skilled in Python, SQL, and PostgreSQL, and I love transforming raw data into actionable insights. Whether it’s identifying patterns, solving problems, or building end-to-end data solutions, I’m passionate about using data to drive impact.

I'm currently looking for opportunities to contribute to meaningful, data-driven projects and grow within a dynamic and collaborative environment.

Beyond studying and projects, I also enjoy going out and taking casual trips 🚗, experimenting in the kitchen 🍳 and expressing myself through art 🎨, whether it’s making crafts ✂️ or spontaneous sketches ✏️.

Let’s connect!
